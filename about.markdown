I'm a software engineer interested in distributed systems, concurrent programming,
cryptography, low-level programming and code optimization. On this blog I'll mostly
document things for myself that I sometimes need, but not often enough that I
can remember it without writing notes.

Titles I've held include both software engineer and research scientist.
I have a Ph.D. in math and I've worked on NLP, self-driving cars, deep learning
for computer graphics and scalable distributed systems serving hundreds of millions
of users.
